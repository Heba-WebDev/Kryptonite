# Kryptonite App API üìÇüóÉÔ∏è

The Kryptonite App API allows users to upload and manage image files using API keys. Below are the key features.

## Features

1. **File Upload Service**
   - Users must have API keys to use the Kryptonite App.
   - Files can be uploaded using the API key without an authentication token.
   - API keys are generated by users.
   - Uploaded files are associated with the user who owns the API key.
   - Only image files are allowed for the moment.

3. **Accessing Images**
   - Users can access all images or a single image without authentication.

4. **API Key invalidation**
   - Users can invalidate an API key, making it unusable.
   - API keys are issued once and never shown again to the user.
   

## Usage

1. Obtain an API key by registering as a Kryptonian.
2. Use the API key to upload image files.
3. Access images via the appropriate endpoints.
